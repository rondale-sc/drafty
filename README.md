# Drafty

This is an application to help my fantasy football league's draft go more smoothly.

It integrates with [My Fantasy League](http://www.myfantasyleague.com/) by parsing the rankings and prefilling displaying 
the information by position on a single screen.  It also integrates a livesearch  option ( based largely on [this](http://orderedlist.com/blog/articles/live-search-with-quicksilver-style-for-jquery/) to quickly 
allow teams to get an at a glance feelfor how what positions are available.

It is a highly customized website that basically only helps to reduce the time it takes to get through draft day which
was previously taking most of an entire day. If it is helpful to anyone please feel free to fork.
